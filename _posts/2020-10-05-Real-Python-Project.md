### I'll call myself an intermediate Pythonista

The [Real Python](www.realpython.com) website has been a go-to resources in my Python journey. I landed on this page again and again as I googled topics from OOP to data structures to pandas. 

[13 Project Ideas for Intermediate Python Developers](https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/) caught my eye. With less than a year of daily Pythoning at work (mostly data science with some development mixed in), could I call myself an intermediate developer? 

The Directory Tree Generator project caught my attention as a tool that I could actually use -- and looked like a good challenge, so I went for it.

My interpretation of the project turned out to have four challenges -- not all of which were Python, specifically:
1. Traversing the directory structure 
2. Printing to the terminal in color
3. Converting the script into a command line utility
4. Making the script executable

I'll turn each of those challenges into a blog post and link to them below. And then I'll post my project to this GitHub repo -- it will be my first posted project for my programming portfolio. Such a satisfying feeling to create a command line tool to do just what I want it to do!
