# "Get up and running in *seconds*," they said.

To be fair, I did get this site up and running in seconds...but only after 
nuking two other iterations of a blog. In total: a few hours plus a few seconds, this blog is up and running.

I've learned a few things along the way:
1. I'm not convinced that github's `gh-pages` is the way to go for blogging. It wasn't the obvious one for me: I couldn't figure out how to branch off of that stand-alone graph. My solution: create a repo with the name of the site. Not an elegant solution, but a solution.
2. Re-acquainted with basic linux commands. It has been ... a few years since I last copied directories, used the vi text editor (please don't suggest emacs), or thought about config variables. It's not like riding a bike after taking some time off -- there's very little muscle memory.
3. Creating a web page from scratch in 2020 is (not shockingly) a completely different experience from the same thing in 1995 at which point I marked up html by hand without an IDE to check for closing tags, and I was super impressed with myself when I made a tiled background from an image. It made the page unreadable, but I didn't care.

So...adventures in Jekyll and Liquid are in my future. Perhaps even some Ruby. I use Python in my day job: I'm a data scientist! And that's all I've got for now. I'm looking forward to playing with the layout of this site, and maybe helping my friends create their own static sites to host their own projects.
