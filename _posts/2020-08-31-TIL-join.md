### Code is read more often than it is written.
Who said it first? Does it matter? It is a point of fact. 

I know my code is inefficient, non-pythonic, and medieval. I know
this even as I write it! And yet I do not know what I do not know.
Until I read someone else's code -- and then I say, "I didn't 
know you could do that!" and then I put it in my (hand-written)
notes with hearts and stars. 

Today I learned about `.join`. I had a list of email addresses to
turn into a string, with the addresses separated by commas.
 
Here is what I was about to do:
```
email_str = ''
email_list = [ ... ] # list of email addresses
for i in range(len(email_list)):
    # purposefully leaving off the last address
    email_str += email_list[i] + ', '
email_str += email_list[-1]
```
This...this is old school thinking. A little pythonic thinking
snuck in there with the negative indexing to get the last 
element of the list.

Then I read a snippet written by a coder I admire...and did a 
double take. What magic is this??? I tried it myself.

`', '.join(email_list)`

That's it. That's what I needed to do. One line.

I'm beginning to think
that when there's some functionality that should exist... it 
already does. Python :snake:, every day I :sparkling_heart: you
a little more.
